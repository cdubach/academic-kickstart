This page serves as a general guideline for all matters related to applying for a CS Minor at McGill.


# General information

The general regulations for the CS minor degree can be found [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/faculties/science/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-science-bsc-minor-computer-science).
As a CS advisor, my role is to guide you through this process and answer any questions you may have about your choice of courses.
If you have any administrative questions, (e.g. course registration issues), these should be directed to the CS admin (<liette.chin@mcgill.ca>)


{{% alert note %}}
Note that doing a CS minor degree will significantly increase your load.
You should probably only pursue a minor degree if you have top grades in your major concentration.

# Timeline

You should start planning for your CS minor as early as possible, and in particular be aware of all the pre-requisites which often includes MATH-222, MATH-223 and MATH-323 for CS courses.
You can apply for the CS minor at any time before the end of your last term.
However, it is highly recommended to apply before the start of your last year, to avoid being in a situation where you realise, at the last minute, that you are missing 1 credit (for instance) to obtain the CS minor degree.

We recommend that your first take the 3 required courses (COMP-202, COMP-206 and COMP-250, or equivalent) as early as possible in your degree.
Once you have acquired these 9 credits worth of courses, you should then apply for the CS minor degree, ideally in your 2nd year.


# The application process

{{% alert warning %}}
Please note that it is YOUR responsibility for checking for pre/co-requisites, whether a course is running or not in given term, or any regulations related to your major degree.
{{% /alert %}}


1. The first step is to obtain the CS minor form that contains all the regulations, specific to your degree.
This includes the mandatory list of courses, which courses count towards the CS minor degree, the number of credits required, if overlaps are allowed with your major degree, and so on.

2. Please contact the CS Senior Admin. & Student Affairs Coordinator (<liette.chin@mcgill.ca>), to obtain the relevant CS minor form for your degree.
When contacting her, please state what is your current major degree and your faculty.

3. Once you have the form, your next step should be to make an initial selection of the courses you are interested to take and list them on the form.
Even if you are unsure, you should plan as far ahead as possible and have a coherent plan in place.
Changes are permitted later on if you decide to change one course for another, or if you decide not to pursue a CS minor degree in the end.

4. Once you have filled up the form, contact me, and I will be happy to answer any remaining questions you may have.
If you are happy with your course selection and have no question just let me know.
Once we are both happy with the form, I will sign it and return it to you, cc'ing the CS Senior Admin. & Student Affairs Coordinator (<liette.chin@mcgill.ca>) (no need for a paper form this year, thanks to COVID).


# Completing the CS minor form

When completing the form, fill up as much as possible and pay attend to all the instructions.
In particular:
* if you are listing a course that you haven't taken yet, leave the Grade column empty
* if credit overlap is permitted and a course credit overlap, indicate it in the comments
* even if you are unsure, fill up the expected Term/Year of any future courses you intend to take

In case you need to change a course on the form in the future, simply contact the CS Senior Admin. & Student Affairs Coordinator (<liette.chin@mcgill.ca>).
Their will then let you know if you a new form is required or not.
