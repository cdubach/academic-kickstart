Several funded PhD/MSc students positions are available.
I'm looking for the brightest students to join my group at McGill working in the area of compilation, parallel language abstractions and hardware design, applied to, or using Machine learning.
McGill has quite a diverse student community and particularly **welcomes applications from under-represented groups** (_e.g._ women, Indigenous people, members of visible minorities).

You can find below some examples of research topics of interests.
But in general, if you have an interest in doing research in compilation and/or hardware design, do not hesitate to contact me. Possible research topics include:

* Neural network accelerator design space exploration;
* Design of domain specific architectures;
* Automatic code generation for neural network accelerators;
* Machine learning applied to compiler problems.


{{< hl >}} The application process is highly competitive.
Please only contact me if you have {{< /hl >}} :
* A high interest in conducting system research;
* Strong programming skills;
* Good knowledge of Linux/Unix;
* A high CGPA (average grade) of at least {{< hl >}} 3.8/4.0 {{< /hl >}} (see [equivalence for international applicants](https://www.mcgill.ca/gradapplicants/international/equivalency)).
