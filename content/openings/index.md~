Several funded PhD/MSc students positions are available in my group at McGill.
I'm looking for the brightest students to join my group working in the area of compilation, parallel language abstractions and hardware design, applied to, or using Machine learning.
McGill has quite a diverse student community and I particularly **welcome applications from under-represented groups** (_e.g._ female applicants).

You can find below some example of research topics that are of interests for me at the moment.
But in general, if you have an interest in doing research in compilation do not hesitate to contact me.
Note that strong programming skills are highly desirable.

Possible research topics include:

* Neural network accelerator design space exploration
* Design of domain specific architectures
* Automatic code generation for neural network accelerators
* Machine learning applied to compiler problems
